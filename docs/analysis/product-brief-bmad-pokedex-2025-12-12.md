# Product Brief: Pokedose

**Date:** 2025-12-12
**Author:** patta

## Executive Summary

Pokedose is a level-based Pokemon puzzle game that challenges players to fill a 3x3 grid with Pokemon matching both row and column criteria. Unlike competitors focused on daily puzzles and rarity scoring across all generations, Pokedose offers 9 hand-crafted levels with progressive concept introduction, focused exclusively on the original 150 Pokemon. Players submit their completed grid and see which cells are correct or incorrect, creating a satisfying learning loop. The game teaches as you play - starting with basic type matching and gradually introducing dual-types, evolution stages, and movesets.

## Core Vision

### Problem Statement

Pokemon fans who want to test their knowledge face a fragmented landscape: existing grid games like PokeDoku and PokeGrid focus on daily puzzles with rarity scoring across 1000+ Pokemon, which overwhelms casual players and provides no structured learning path. There's no progression system to build skills, and no way to focus on a specific generation.

### Problem Impact

Players who aren't Pokemon experts feel excluded from grid puzzle games. The "rarity scoring" mechanic rewards obscure knowledge rather than mastery. Without levels, there's no sense of progression or achievement - just a daily puzzle that resets.

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

| Competitor | Limitation |
|------------|------------|
| **PokeDoku** | Daily-only, all generations, rarity scoring |
| **PokeGrid** | No progression system, overwhelming scope |
| **PokeGrids** | Focuses on unique picks over mastery |

All competitors optimize for hardcore fans. None offer a structured, level-based experience for players who want to learn and improve.

### Proposed Solution

Pokedose: A level-based Pokemon grid puzzle focused on the original 150.

**Core Features:**
- **3x3 grid puzzle** - Match Pokemon to row AND column criteria
- **9 hand-crafted levels** - Progressive concept introduction:
  - Early levels: Basic type matching
  - Mid levels: Dual-types, evolution stages
  - Later levels: Movesets, combined criteria
- **Full submit validation** - Submit complete grid, incorrect cells highlighted on failure
- **Gen 1 focus** - Manageable scope, nostalgic appeal (first 150 Pokemon)
- **Learn as you play** - Onboarding ramp teaches criteria types progressively

**Stretch Goal:**
- Integrated Pokedex - Reference tool to learn while playing

**Future Additions (post-validation):**
- Daily puzzle mode
- Generated puzzles
- Retention mechanics (leaderboards, time trials)

### Key Differentiators

1. **Progressive onboarding** - Teaches criteria types gradually (only Pokemon grid game that does this)
2. **Gen 1 focus** - Nostalgia + manageable scope (150 vs 1000+ Pokemon)
3. **Mastery over obscurity** - Learn and improve, not "pick the rarest Pokemon"
4. **Clear feedback loop** - Submit → see what's wrong → retry → master
5. **Validate before scaling** - 9 levels first, daily puzzles later
