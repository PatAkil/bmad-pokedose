## Successes & Strengths

1. **100% Story Completion** - All 4 stories delivered in a single day
2. **Strong Testing Discipline** - Test coverage grew from 4 to 78 tests (20x increase)
3. **Architecture Compliance** - All files in correct locations per architecture spec
4. **Bundle Size Under Budget** - 307KB vs 500KB budget (39% headroom)
5. **Code Review Process Working** - Caught real issues before merge
6. **Solid Data Foundation** - 150 Pokemon with accurate Gen 1 types, evolution stages, movesets

---

## Challenges & Growth Areas

1. **Every Story Required Code Review Fixes**
   - Story 1-1: Missing files (src/data/.gitkeep, Game.test.tsx)
   - Story 1-2: Gen 1 type accuracy (Fairy/Steel didn't exist in Gen 1)
   - Story 1-3: AC violation - levels 4-5 missing dual-type criteria
   - Story 1-4: No HIGH/MEDIUM issues (cleanest review)

2. **AC Interpretation Errors**
   - Story 1-3 missed "AND" in "dual-types AND evolution stages"
   - Root cause: Skimming rather than careful reading of requirements

3. **Incomplete Verification**
   - Story 1-4 Task 5: Manual smoke test not performed
   - Marked done without visual verification

---

## Key Insights & Learnings

1. **Code review is an effective safety net** - Caught accuracy and completeness issues
2. **AC interpretation needs word-by-word attention** - Small words like "AND" matter
3. **Manual verification steps shouldn't be skipped** - Mark incomplete if not done
4. **First-pass quality can improve** - Relying less on review as catch-all
5. **Fast velocity is achievable with good foundations** - Full epic in one day

## Action Items

### Process Improvements

| Action | Owner | Success Criteria |
|--------|-------|------------------|
| Add AC verification checklist to story completion | Bob (SM) | Documented checklist used for Epic 2 |
| Read ACs twice before implementation, once after | All Devs | Reduce code review fix rate in Epic 2 |

### Technical Debt

| Item | Owner | Priority |
|------|-------|----------|
| Complete PokemonSprite smoke test | Charlie | HIGH |

### Team Agreements

- Continue rigorous code review process
- Pay extra attention to AND/OR language in acceptance criteria
- Don't skip manual verification steps - mark incomplete if not done

---

## Epic 2 Preparation

### Dependencies Status

- ✅ Pokemon data layer (getPokemonById, getAllPokemon)
- ✅ Level data layer (getLevelById, getAllLevels)
- ✅ PokemonSprite component (code complete)
- ✅ Project structure (features/, types/, lib/)

### Critical Path

- [ ] Complete PokemonSprite visual smoke test (Charlie - today)

### No Significant Discoveries Requiring Epic Updates

Epic 2 plan remains valid as designed.

---

## Next Steps

1. Charlie completes PokemonSprite smoke test
2. Update Epic 1 status to `done` in sprint-status.yaml
3. Begin Epic 2: Story 2.1 (Game State Management)

---

## Retrospective Metrics

- **Duration:** ~30 minutes
- **Participation:** Full team engagement
- **Action Items Generated:** 3
- **Team Agreements:** 3
- **Blockers Identified:** 1 (smoke test - resolved same day)
